[[appendix]]

== Cluster-Wide Metrics

[cols="h,a,a"]
|===
|Name|Description|Tags

|blockingWorkerCount
|Number of non-cooperative workers employed.
.6+|_none_

Each Hazelcast member will have one instance of this metric.

|jobs.submitted
|Number of computational jobs submitted.

|jobs.completedSuccessfully
|Number of computational jobs successfully completed.

|jobs.completedWithFailure
|Number of computational jobs that have failed.

|jobs.executionStarted
|Number of computational job executions started. Each job can
execute multiple times, for example when it’s restarted or
suspended and then resumed.

|jobs.executionTerminated
|Number of computational job executions finished. Each job can
execute multiple times, for example when it’s restarted or
suspended and then resumed.

|iterationCount
|The total number of iterations the driver of tasklets in
cooperative thread N made. It should increase by at least 250
iterations/s. Lower value means some of the cooperative
processors blocks for too long. Somewhat lower value is normal
if there are many tasklets assigned to the processor. Lower
value affects the latency.
.2+|_cooperativeWorker_

Each Hazelcast member will have one of this metric for each of its
cooperative worker threads.

|taskletCount
|The number of assigned tasklets to cooperative thread N.

== Job-specific Metrics

All job specific metrics have their `job=<jobId>` and
`exec=<executionId>` tags set and most also have the
`vertex=<vertexName>` tag set (with very few exceptions). This means
that most of these metrics will have at least one instance for each
vertex of each current job execution.

Additionally, if the vertex sourcing them is a data source or data sink,
then the `source` or `sink` tags will also be set to true.

|Names|Description|Tags

|executionStartTime
|Start time of the current execution of the job (epoch time in milliseconds).
.2+|_job, exec_


There will be a single instance of these metrics for each job
execution.

|executionCompletionTime
|Completion time of the current execution of the job (epoch time
in milliseconds).

|snapshotBytes
|Total number of bytes written out in the last snapshot.
.2+|_job, exec, vertex_

There will be a single instance of these metrics for each
vertex.

|snapshotKeys
|Total number of keys written out in the last snapshot.

|distributedBytesIn
|Total number of bytes received from remote members.
.4+|_job, exec, vertex, ordinal_

Each Hazelcast member will have an instance of these metrics for each
ordinal of each vertex of each job execution.

Note: These metrics are only present for distributed edges (ie.
edges producing network traffic).

|distributedBytesOut
|Total number of bytes sent to remote members.

|distributedItemsIn
|Total number of items received from remote members.

|distributedItemsOut
|Total number of items sent to remote members.

|topObservedWm
|This value is equal to the highest coalescedWm on any input edge
of this processor.
.6+|_job, exec, vertex, proc_

Each Hazelcast member will have one instances of these metrics for
each processor instance N, the N denotes the global processor
index. Processor is the parallel worker doing the work of the
vertex.

|coalescedWm
|The highest watermark received from all inputs that was sent to
the processor to handle.

|lastForwardedWm
|Last watermark emitted by the processor to output.

|lastForwardedWmLatency
|The difference between <i>lastForwardedWn</i> and the system
time at the moment when metrics were collected.

|queuesCapacity
|The total capacity of input queues.

|queuesSize
|The total number of items waiting in input queues.

|topObservedWm
|The highest received watermark from any input on edge N.
.5+|_job, exec, vertex, proc, ordinal_

Each Hazelcast member will have one instance of these metrics for each
edge M (input or output) of each processor N. N is the global
processor index and M is either the ordinal of the edge or has
the value snapshot for output items written to state snapshot.

|coalescedWm
|The highest watermark received from all upstream processors on
edge N.

|emittedCount
|The number of emitted items. This number includes watermarks,
snapshot barriers etc. Unlike _distributedItemsOut_, it
includes items emitted items to local processors.

|receivedCount
|The number of received items. This number does not include
watermarks, snapshot barriers etc. It’s the number of items the
Processor.process method will receive.

|receivedBatches
|The number of received batches. `Processor.process`
receives a batch of items at a time, this is the number of such
batches. By dividing _receivedCount_ by
_receivedBatches_, you get the average batch size. It will
be 1 under low load.

|numInFlightOps
|The number of pending (in flight) operations when using
asynchronous mapping processors. See https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/processor/Processors.html#mapUsingServiceAsyncP-com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.ServiceFactory-int-boolean-com.hazelcast.function.FunctionEx-com.hazelcast.function.BiFunctionEx-[Processors.mapUsingServiceAsyncP].
.6+|_job, exec, vertex, proc, procType_

Processor specific metrics, only certain types of processors
have them. The _procType_ tag can be used to identify the
exact type of processor sourcing them. Like all processor
metrics, each Hazelcast member will have one instances of these
metrics for each processor instance N, the N denotes the global
processor index.

|totalKeys
|The number of active keys being tracked by a session window
processor.


|totalWindows
|The number of active windows being tracked by a session window
processor. See
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/processor/Processors.html#aggregateToSessionWindowP-long-long-java.util.List-java.util.List-com.hazelcast.jet.aggregate.AggregateOperation-com.hazelcast.jet.core.function.KeyedWindowResultFunction-[Processors.aggregateToSessionWindowP].


|totalFrames
|The number of active frames being tracked by a sliding window processor.


|totalKeysInFrames
|The number of grouping keys associated with the current active
frames of a sliding window processor. See
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/processor/Processors.html#aggregateToSlidingWindowP-java.util.List-java.util.List-com.hazelcast.jet.core.TimestampKind-com.hazelcast.jet.core.SlidingWindowPolicy-long-com.hazelcast.jet.aggregate.AggregateOperation-com.hazelcast.jet.core.function.KeyedWindowResultFunction-[Processors.aggregateToSlidingWindowP].


|lateEventsDropped
|The number of late events dropped by various processor, due to
the watermark already having passed their windows.

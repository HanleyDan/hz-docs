This section shows you how to use Hazelcast with Docker. We explain
some options and parameters used in the examples, but otherwise assume
you are familiar with Docker in general. Visit the https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[official documentation^] for a basic introduction.

== Starting a Hazelcast Member and Cluster

Paste the following into your command line:

[tabs] 
==== 
hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 

[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
--

hazelcast-enterprise::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
docker run -e 5701:5701 HZ_LICENSE_KEY=<Your Enterprise License Key> hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
--

hazelcast-enterprise-4-rhel8::
+
[source,shell]
----
# You must be logged into Red Hat Container Registry

docker run -e 5701:5701 HZ_LICENSE_KEY=<Your Enterprise License Key> registry.connect.redhat.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-4-rhel8:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
====

These commands pull Hazelcast Docker image and start a new Hazelcast member.

On Linux, you can omit the `-p 5701:5701` part, but on other platforms
you may need it if the container's network isn't directly exposed to the
host machine.

You should see a log on your terminal similar to this:

[source,plain]
----
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.17.0.2]:5701 - c0640efd-02ae-4595-aace-d944e1e1ad97 this
]
----

The command line prompt doesn't return, which allows you to easily stop or restart
Hazelcast. Note Hazelcast's IP address, you'll need it later.

Now, you have a single Hazelcast member.
To ensure your codes will work properly, you should test
it locally in a cluster with multiple members as well; testing on a single member hides some
common serialization issues your code may have. Let's start another
Hazelcast container to have a second member so that a 2-member cluster will be formed.
For this, run `docker run` from another terminal window, using a
different port mapping than the first member you created:

[tabs] 
==== 
hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 

[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 5702:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
--

hazelcast-enterprise::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
docker run -e 5702:5701 HZ_LICENSE_KEY=<Your Enterprise License Key> hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
--

hazelcast-enterprise-4-rhel8::
+
[source,shell]
----
# You must be logged into Red Hat Container Registry

docker run -e 5702:5701 HZ_LICENSE_KEY=<Your Enterprise License Key> registry.connect.redhat.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-4-rhel8:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
====

The two Hazelcast members will discover each other automatically. Wait for
output like the following in the logs:

[source,plain]
----
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
    Member [172.17.0.2]:5701 - c0640efd-02ae-4595-aace-d944e1e1ad97
    Member [172.17.0.3]:5701 - 011a9dd4-936f-4170-a7c6-622b7430b789 this
]
----


You can start additional containers as described above to add
more members to your cluster.

You can use the IP of any Hazelcast member, for example, to submit a job. Hazelcast takes care of
distributing it across the whole cluster.

You can also start a Hazelcast cluster with Docker Compose. See the <<docker-compose, Using Docker Compose section>>.

== Starting Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center provides an easy way to monitor Hazelcast
cluster and running jobs. See its https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/latest[documentation]
for more information. Start it like this:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 8081:8081 -e HAZELCAST_MEMBER_ADDRESS=172.17.0.2 hazelcast/management-center:$MANAGEMENT_CENTER_VERSION
----

After a few seconds you can access Management Center on
\http://localhost:8081, the default
username/password are admin/admin.

== Submitting a Job

The Hazelcast distribution contains an example pipeline called `hello-world`.
You can use this pipeline to submit your first job using Docker.

For this, you first need to download the Hazelcast code samples to have the example pipeline,
then connect to the Hazelcast member you've started on Docker, and submit (deploy) a job to this member
using the example pipeline. See the following steps:

. Download the code samples, and go to the extracted directory using the below commands:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples
cd hazelcast-code-samples
----

. Connect to the Hazelcast member and submit the `hello-world` job to it using the below command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)"/examples:/examples --rm hazelcast/hazelcast hazelcast -t 172.17.0.2 submit /examples/hello-world.jar
----
+
The Docker parameters are as follows:
+
* `-it` tells Docker to start an interactive session, allowing you to
  cancel the `submit` command with `Ctrl+C`
* `-v "$(pwd)"/examples:/examples` mounts the folder `examples` from
  your current directory as `/examples` inside the container
* `--rm` tells Docker to remove the container from its local cache once
  it exits
+
These are the parameters for `hazelcast submit`:
+
* `-t 172.17.0.2`, short for `--targets`, is the address of the Hazelcast
  member to connect to
* `/examples/hello-world.jar` is the JAR containing the code which will
  create a pipeline and submit it

. List the jobs running inside the cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm hazelcast/hazelcast hazelcast -t 172.17.0.2 list-jobs
ID                  STATUS             SUBMISSION TIME         NAME
045e-987c-1940-0001 RUNNING            2020-05-18T20:08:03.020 hello-world
----

To cancel the running job:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm hazelcast/hazelcast hazelcast -t 172.17.0.2 cancel hello-world
----

== Configuration

You can configure various aspects of your cluster and environment using Docker.

=== Memory

By default, Hazelcast configures the JVM with `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80.0`.
This limits the JVM heap to 80% of the RAM available to the container.
We recommend you leave this as-is and control Hazelcast's memory size with the
Docker parameter `--memory`. For example, this will start Hazelcast with 1.6
GB assigned to the JVM:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --memory 2g --rm hazelcast/hazelcast
----

=== JAVA_OPTS

To change the JVM parameters directly, use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment
variable. Hazelcast passes it to the JVM when starting. For example:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --memory 2g -e JAVA_OPTS="-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=85.0" --rm hazelcast/hazelcast
----

Make sure to leave enough free RAM for Metaspace and other overheads.

=== Custom Hazelcast Configuration File

You can configure Hazelcast with your own `hazelcast.yaml/xml`
by replacing the default ones in the container at
`/opt/hazelcast`. We recommend that you use the default
configuration file as a starting point:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm hazelcast/hazelcast cat /opt/hazelcast/hazelcast.yaml > hazelcast.yaml
----

Now edit the file and apply it when starting Hazelcast:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)"/hazelcast.yaml:/opt/hazelcast/hazelcast.yaml hazelcast/hazelcast
----

=== Extend Hazelcast's CLASSPATH with Custom Jars and Files

If you have to add more classes or files to Hazelcast's classpath, one way to
do it is to put them in a folder, e.g., `ext`, mount it to the
container, and set the `CLASSPATH` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -e CLASSPATH="/opt/hazelcast/ext/" -v /path/to/ext:/opt/hazelcast/ext hazelcast/hazelcast
----

If you have just one file to add, it's simpler to mount it directly into
Hazelcast's `lib` folder:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v /path/to/my.jar:/opt/hazelcast-jet/lib/my.jar hazelcast/hazelcast
----

=== Changing Logging Level

You can set the logging level using the `LOGGING_LEVEL` environment
variable:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -e LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG hazelcast/hazelcast
----

Available logging levels are (from highest to lowest): `FATAL`, `ERROR`,
`WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`. The default logging level is `INFO`.

If you need more control over logging, you can supply your own
`log4j2.properties` file. Use the default one as the starting point:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm hazelcast/hazelcast cat /opt/hazelcast/log4j2.properties > log4j2.properties
----

Edit the file and mount it when starting Hazelcast:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v /path/to/log4j2.properties:/opt/hazelcast/log4j2.properties hazelcast/hazelcast
----

== Using Docker Compose

You can start a Hazelcast cluster managed by Docker Compose. This
also makes it easier to customize Hazelcast with configuration files, mounted
directories etc.

Here's a simple `docker-compose.yml`:

[source,xml]
----
version: '3'

services:
  hazelcast:
    image: hazelcast/hazelcast
    ports:
      - "5701-5703:5701"
----

Now you can start a 3-member Hazelcast cluster:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up --scale hazelcast=3
----

You should eventually see a 3-member cluster has formed:

[source,plain]
----
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
    Member [172.21.0.3]:5701 - 99d3de67-8c5d-452b-8165 -085a4cd1fcda
    Member [172.21.0.2]:5701 - 64f5b01b-847e-49e0-87f2 -db2a6f7750b7
    Member [172.21.0.4]:5701 - ffa362f9-617d-42bc-a74c -05ce857e8e48 this
]
----

The `ports` section says that port 5701 from each container should be
mapped to a port from the range 5701-5703. Increase the range if you
want to start more than three instances.

You can provide a custom `hazelcast.yaml/xml`
configuration file by using a volume:

[source,xml]
----
version: '3'

services:

  hazelcast:
    image: hazelcast/hazelcast
    ports:
      - "5701-5703:5701"
    volumes:
      - ./hazelcast.yaml:/opt/hazelcast/hazelcast.yaml
----

== Using Dockerfile

In addition to the aforementioned Docker methods,
you can also create your own Docker image using Dockerfiles for these purposes
to start Hazelcast and submit jobs.

For example, let's create a Docker image with the code of the `hello-world` job
from the <<submitting-a-job, Submitting a Job section>> and submit it to Hazelcast.

For this, you first need to create the Dockerfile as follows:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM hazelcast/hazelcast
ADD examples/hello-world.jar /examples/
ENV HAZELCAST_MEMBER_ADDRESS 172.17.0.2
CMD ["sh", "-c", "hazelcast -t $HAZELCAST_MEMBER_ADDRESS submit /examples/hello-world.jar"]
----

The Hazelcast address is exposed through the `HAZELCAST_MEMBER_ADDRESS` environment
variable, with the default value of `172.17.0.2`. This makes it easy to
pass a different address with `docker run -e HAZELCAST_MEMBER_ADDRESS=<another.one>`.

Then, you create your own Docker image using the following command, giving it the name `hazelcast-hello-world`:

[source,bash]
----
docker build . -t hazelcast-hello-world
----

You will see an output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
Sending build context to Docker daemon  77.35MB
...
Successfully built 6bc0f527b69c
Successfully tagged hazelcast-hello-world:latest
----

Finally, you submit the job as follows:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it hazelcast-jet-hello-world
----

== Building a Custom Image from the Slim Image

Hazelcast offers a slim Docker image that
contains just the core Hazelcast engine. When image size is a concern, you can use it
as the starting point to build your custom image with just the
extensions you need.

Let's create and start a Docker image for Hazelcast with the Kafka extension.
In an empty directory, create a Dockerfile with the following content:

[source,dockerfile,subs="attributes+"]
----
FROM hazelcast:{page-component-version}-slim
ARG HZ_HOME=/opt/hazelcast
ARG REPO_URL=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast
ADD $REPO_URL/hazelcast-kafka/5.0/hazelcast-kafka-5.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar $HZ_HOME/lib/
# ... more ADD statements ...
----

NOTE: To find the available extensions and their URLs, open the
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast[Maven
URL] in your browser.

Build the image from the above Dockerfile using the following command, giving it the name `hazelcast-with-kafka`:

[source,bash]
----
docker build . -t hazelcast-with-kafka
----

Start the Docker image as follows:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast-with-kafka
----
